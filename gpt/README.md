# DSL.txt
The DSL.txt file serves as the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) specification for the DiaVio system. It defines a set of rules and structures that align real-world accident reports, described in natural language, with violation scenarios in simulation testing. 

# generate_Dataset.py
The generate_Dataset.py script is designed to process text files containing accident-related information. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to generate structured responses based on the content of the files, following the predefined rules outlined in the crash DSL (Domain-Specific Language).
